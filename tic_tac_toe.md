I. Tic Tac Toe
Domain model the tic tac toe code draw out diagrams explaining how objects relate to one another.

Are there classes over 100 lines of code, are there other classes that methods can be broken out into other classes?   

Are there methods over five lines of code, how can these be made simpler?  What techniques did I use to make the methods smaller.

Did I separate out Classes that represent something, vs code that takes action

What benefits or costs did this have
Now looking at your own classes and code, what lessons can you draw from this.

How would you domain model the hangman codebase if you were starting from scratch

II. Other Code

Domain model your partner's code - draw out diagrams explaining how objects relate to one another.
Are there classes over 100 lines of code, are there other classes that methods can be moved into
Are there methods over five lines of code, how can these be made simpler
Are there data structures (data in the form of arrays, or hashes) that can be made into objects  
Some code has object specifically in charge of taking action (eg. Controller/executioner, etc)
Does this help to make the code clearer?  How?
Classes that represent something, vs code that takes action

Please slack me the 2-3 things action items that the person should do.
And a specific example of where this can be implemented.
